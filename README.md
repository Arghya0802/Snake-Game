This is a classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is simple and addictive, and it will bring back fond memories of the classic Snake game that was popular on old Nokia phones.

# Features
- Simple and intuitive gameplay
- Increasing difficulty level as the snake grows longer
- Score tracking
- Game over screen with the option to restart

# Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# Getting Started
To get started with the Snake Game, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/Arghya0802/Snake-Game.git
- Navigate to the project directory
- Open index.html in your preferred browser

# Gameplay
The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat the food without hitting the walls or the snake's own body. The snake moves automatically, and you can change its direction using the arrow keys. As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making it harder to avoid collision with the walls and the body.

# Score Tracking
Each time the snake eats the food, the score increases by 10 points. The score is displayed on the top right corner of the screen.

# Game Over
If the snake collides with the walls or its own body, the game is over. A game over screen will appear with the option to restart the game.
